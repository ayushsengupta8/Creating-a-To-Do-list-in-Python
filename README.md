# Creating-a-To-Do-list-in-Python
Welcome to my repository!

I have used Python3 for coding a To-Do list. This list has 4 options, for adding an item, for removing a specific item, for viewing the list and lastly, for exiting the loop. I have used for and while loops for the same. This is a very simple program done by me in the day 1 of programming with Python.

In order to run the program, right click and open terminal from the folder itself. Then type "python3 app.py" and press enter and wait for the program to run. You will be shown a menu which has 4 options, and you can proceed accordingly, as I have mentioned above. In case you want to exit the program, press 4.

I hope you liked my simple app.
